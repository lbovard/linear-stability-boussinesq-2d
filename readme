This is linear stability code that solves the Boussinesq Navier-Stokes (BNS) equations.

The idea is to take the BNS equations and derive the linear stability equations. From there, we numerically solve the equations for long term behaviour to determine the growth rate of the fastest growing mode. 

Method:
This code uses spectral methods w/ 2/3 de-aliasing rule to evaluate derivatives. Pressure is eliminated via projection in the fourier plane. The time stepping is done via a 2nd order Adams-Bashforth scheme. We solve for u,v,w,rho and the growth rate of the linear perturbation.  
The equations solved are 3.3 - 3.4 of Billant and Chomaz 2000c. 

To do:
add NETCDF
maybe AB higher order??
fix up file handling
 -can declare some global strings
 -for NETCDF add distinguishing data labels (i.e. 1-60 vs 60-100 and so on)


This code is currently run on the supercomputing cluster Sharcnet.
